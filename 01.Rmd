```{r}
data <- read_csv("01-input", col_names = FALSE) %>%
  rename(depth = X1)
```

# Part 1

How many days did the depth increase?

```{r}
with(data, sum(depth > lag(depth), na.rm = TRUE))

```

# Part 2

How many days had increasing rolling three-measurement windows?


```{r}
data %>%
  mutate(three_day_sum = depth + lead(depth) + lead(depth, 2)) %>%
  with(sum(three_day_sum > lag(three_day_sum), na.rm = TRUE))
```
